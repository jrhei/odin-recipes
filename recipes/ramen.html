        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="description"><strong>Ramen</strong> is a Japanese noodle soup, 
            with a combination of a rich flavoured broth, 
            one of a variety of types of noodle and a selection 
            of meats or vegetables, often topped with a boiled 
            egg. In Japan ramen is considered a fast food, with
