        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="description"> <strong>Arroz caldo</strong> literally translates to hot rice or rice stew.  
            This Filipino rice porridge is a great representation of 
            Philippine history as this dish is a combination
            of Spanish and Chinese influences.</p>
        <p class="description"> 
            Though Spanish by name, it's very similar to Chinese congee.  
            Some variations take the Spanish influence a bit further 
            with the addition of saffron to the chicken broth.
